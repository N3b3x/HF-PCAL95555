# Example Projects

This folder contains minimal examples demonstrating how to integrate the
`PACL95555` driver on various platforms. Each subdirectory targets a different
development environment.

- **arduino/** – Sketch showing how to use the library with the Arduino `Wire`
  library.
- **esp32/** – Example application for ESP-IDF.
- **stm32/** – Example `main.cpp` using the STM32 HAL.

These examples are intentionally small; copy the relevant code into your
project and adapt the pin numbers and I2C configuration for your hardware.
