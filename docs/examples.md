# Examples

A set of minimal projects is provided in the [examples](../examples) directory. Each subfolder demonstrates the driver on a different platform.

- **arduino/** – Sketch using the Arduino `Wire` library.
- **esp32/** – ESP-IDF application.
- **stm32/** – STM32 HAL example.

To build an example, copy the code into your own project and adjust the I²C pins and device address for your hardware. The examples mirror the instructions in [Platform Integration](./platform_integration.md).
