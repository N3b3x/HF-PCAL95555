# Contributing ü§ù

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests and pull requests. To keep things organized please follow the steps below.

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch.
2. **Write clear commit messages** describing your changes.
3. **Update or add documentation** in the `docs/` folder when your changes modify the API or behavior.
4. **Run `make test`** and ensure that all tests pass before opening a pull request.
5. **Describe your changes** in the PR template so reviewers understand the motivation and implementation.

For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal.
