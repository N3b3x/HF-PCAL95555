# Documentation Guidelines

To keep the documentation clear and consistent, follow these rules when contributing updates:

1. **Use Markdown headings** to create a logical hierarchy.
2. **Prefer short code blocks** that highlight a specific concept.
3. **Link to other documents** for deeper explanations rather than repeating content.
4. **Keep line lengths under 120 characters** to improve readability in text editors.
5. **Provide context** for example code so users know where to place it in their applications.

When in doubt, mirror the style used in the existing documents. PRs that add new features should also update the relevant docs to maintain synchronization.
